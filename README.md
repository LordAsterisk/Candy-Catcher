Halloween is a great day to get some delicious candy. But with a pandemic going around, sometimes going from house to house isn't the safest plan. Luckily, this interactive sketch has you covered! Click the screen and watch as candy of various sizes tumble down into your cute Halloween bucket. It's so fun, you can almost taste the candy!

Don't mind the spiders bouncing up and down. They just want to add some spoooooky fun.

This project had a few problems along the way: misplacing of push() and pull(), accidentally scaling into the negative numbers, and making spiders a variable instead of a class. Luckily I was able to fix those problems in the end, and it was all a good learning experience.
